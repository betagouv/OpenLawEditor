### `wikipedia-js`

The [Meteor port](https://atmospherejs.com/benjaminrh/wikipedia-js) is really a [simple inclusion](https://github.com/BenjaminRH/meteor-wikipedia-js/blob/master/wikipedia_js.js).

The [client itself](https://github.com/kenshiro-o/wikipedia-js) is very simple… but perhaps too much. The main issue is that it queries only the English wikipedia, with no configuration switch.
At the time of writing, the [README](https://github.com/kenshiro-o/wikipedia-js/blob/master/README.md) states features will be added “soon”, yet the repo has not been updated for more than 18 months.
